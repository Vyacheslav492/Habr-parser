# Habr Python Articles Parser

## ðŸ”¹ Notes

* The script uses `requests` to download pages and `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing.
* If Habrâ€™s structure changes, you may need to adjust the CSS selectors for titles and descriptions.
* For large amounts of data, it is recommended to add pauses between requests or use Selenium to avoid being blocked by Habr.
